Welcome to the Larmor Instrument Manual
=======================================

A flexible instrument for high throughput SANS, Spin-Echo SANS and the development of 
Larmor precession techniques.

The manual provides technical details of the instrument layout and capabilities as well
as instructions on the operation, data reduction and analysis.

The instrument web page and links therin to the ISIS SANS group provide a further resource
of information so if something is missing (very likely at the moment) please check there
first before contacting a member of the Larmor team.
