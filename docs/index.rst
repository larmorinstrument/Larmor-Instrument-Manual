*Welcome to the Larmor instrument manual*

Introduction
------------

Larmor is a neutron scattering instrument constructed at the `ISIS neutron and muon source
<https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx>`_ . Larmor was constructed as a time-of-flight Small Angle
Neutrons Scattering (SANS) instrument with the capability to perform and develop a variety of Larmor
precession measurements.

.. note::

   This project is new and is being developed by the Larmor scientist team.
